<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>My name is Ariele Martinez and I am enrolled in the Web Design Track at Startup Institute New York. I am a 
Brooklynite who loves stargazing, drinking tea, and playing with cats. My background includes a BA in Psychology 
from Bryn Mawr College and experience in education and non-profit development. I fully love coding and I can't wait
to learn more about front-end development and user-centered design principles!</p>
