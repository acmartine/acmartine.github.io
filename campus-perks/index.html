      <!--ABOUT-->
      <div class="container-fluid process-cont">

      </a>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Creating visuals and a landing page for Campus Perks, an on-demand tutoring platform.
        </p>
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>
          Our service was dedicated to matching students who need tutoring with other students who had previously taken the class. We set out to make the webpage eye-catching, while streamlining the user flow of the product and setting ourselves apart from other tutoring services available.
        </p>
        <h1>Audience</h1>
        <p>
          Target users were college students in NYC-area colleges and universities. They were chosen based on the founder's experiences in higher education and in the common issue students face of finding an on-campus tutor on short notice.
        </p>
        <h1>Team &amp; Role</h1>
        <p>
          I worked alongside 2 web developers, one of whom was the founder of CampusPerks. We all worked together to hash out the details of the app. I was responsible for the visuals and the front end of the site
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles:
          <ul>
            <li>UX/UI design</li>
            <li>Front-end development</li>
            <li>Graphics: Movie, illustrations, page layout, typography, logo design</li>
            <li>Copywriting</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>Constraints</h1>
        <p>
          Our biggest constraint was an undefined problem. The founders started out by planning to do a full product release, before realizing that more research was necessary in order to fine-tune the early product properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          After deliberation, we decided to create a landing page to showcase the product and generate interest, rather than release the minimum viable product right out of the gate.
        </p>
        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <p>
          In order to set our site apart from those of the other tutoring services available, we needed striking visuals and copy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I researched two other on-demand tutoring services - Sesh Tutoring and KramTutors - that launched around the same time as CampusPerks. Sesh used a red palette, while KramTutors used blue, so I chose a green palette to set CampusPerks apart. I also chose green to instill a sense of calm and to subconsciously reinforce CampusPerks' standing as a college-centered product (green &#8594;  ivy &#8594;   Ivy League &#8594;  academic excellence &#8594;   our service!).
        </p>
        <p>
          I also created a series of minimal vector illustrations to walk the user through how the product works. I made sure to keep the user represented in each image to emphasize how they interact with each of the different steps.
        </p>
        <p class="caption">
          <img src="img/camperks.jpg" class="img-responsive" height="70%" width="70%" /><br />
          <em>Early illustration sketches</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose to integrate a video background, which I put together and optimized for web. It was important to showcase diverse scenes of students both studying and enjoying campus life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built the front end of the site using Bootstrap, then handed it over to the developer, who converted the site into a Rails app and integrated the MailChimp API so that interested users could sign up.
        </p>
