        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Logo design and blog styling for a beauty blog focusing exclusively on nail polish.
        </p>
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>
          The primary challenge was to create a visually-friendly blog. The site is for a nail art hobbyist establishing her first blog and who was eager to share her work publicly. She wanted photos of her work to feature prominently and also needed a banner image. Since the blog's focus is nail art, the design had to be less content-driven and more visually-driven.
        </p>
        <h1>Audience</h1>
        <p>
          Target users are anyone who likes nail art and polish, and those who want to learn more about how to accomplish certain looks. As is common on beauty blogs, the posts go into great detail on the different brands and techniques used for each nail look.
        </p>
        <h1>Team &amp; Role</h1>
        <p>
          I worked as a one-woman team on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles:
          <ul>
            <li>Logotype design</li>
            <li>Colors</li>
            <li>WordPress.org installation and setup</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>Constraints</h1>
        <p>
           There is no specific niche set just yet within the realm of nail polish blogs. The site's main role right now is in displaying nail art. The owner just wanted a simple blog design to start, with room to grow as time passes. There was also a time crunch, so I used a WordPress.org template out of the door but plan to switch to a custom design soon.
        </p>
        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <p>
          Since this is a starter theme, the blog design had 2 major visual foci: the topmost banner, and the photos of the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The images had to be featured prominently. Since I was working under a time crunch, I chose a WordPress.org template that worked well with post images and which also put the topmost image at a very prominent size and position. I also set the sidebar of the site to feature random posts with thumbnails so that more of the nail art could be featured on the main page.
        </p>
        <p>
          For colors, I stuck to a simple and elegant color palette of black, gold, and white. The gold gives the logo enough "pop" to stand out on the page, and the color palette itself is simple enough to allow room for elaboration in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to design a logotype to serve as the main banner on the blog. This logotype could then scale down for use in social media icons (I also created an icon for the blog's Instagram account). To that end, I chose a brush font in gold to mimic the strokes of a nail polish brush.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from the main page, I also included an About Me page for the author, plus a Disclosure Policy page for legal purposes and to elaborate on the blogger's policies in accepting sponsorships.
        </p>
