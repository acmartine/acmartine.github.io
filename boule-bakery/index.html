        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Creating a website for a local bakery seeking to establish their online presence.
        </p>
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>
          Boule Bakery had never had their own website before speaking with me. Their only online presence was on scattered social media sites, each with conflicting and out-of-date information. The challenge was to centralize and unify their most recent information, presenting it clearly and nicely.
        </p>
        <h1>Audience</h1>
        <p>
          Target users were new and recurring customers. The staff wanted to attract new customers with the site and also keep regular customers updated with in-house menu items.
        </p>
        <h1>Team &amp; Role</h1>
        <p>
          One-woman team on executing this project. I consulted bakery staff for a menu and for the basic information information they wanted to display on the website. Made sure to keep them up to date on the development process, starting with a bare-bones demo site. Once they approved it, I fleshed out the visuals and interactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Roles: 
         <ul>
           <li>UX/UI design</li>
           <li>Front-end development using Bootstrap</li>
           <li>Visual design (fonts, color, layout, images)</li> 
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
         The staff provided much of the basic content, and I filled the gaps in as needed.
       </p>
       <h1>Constraints</h1>
       <p>
        The bakery had no previous online presence, so the content and visuals were created from scratch. This was both a constraint and a fun opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bakery was understaffed, so I had no professional-quality photos of the business space itself nor its products since the staff didn't have the time to get these. I had to get resourceful and use stock photos until they could obtain the photos.
      </p>
      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      <p>
        Once the staff and I agreed on the site, they sent over their menu, core information (address, business hours, etc.) and notes for what they wanted to include in the site. Bakery staff and I agreed on a 1-page website for easy reading on the go. To develop the site, I decided on Bootstrap for its mobile-friendliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest challenges was organizing the menu from an improvised in-house whiteboard to a more polished online version. The bakery's in-house menu was written on a whiteboard, so I was challenged to clean it up and make it presentable for online.
     </p>
     <p class="caption">
      <img src="img/bbmenu.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="50%" height="50%"><br /><em>The bakery's in-house menu. We had a lot of back-and-forth since some of their items and prices had changed!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the goal was to drive sales, I wanted to make people hungry as soon as they saw the site (Diabolical? Yes. Effective? Also yes.). I scoured stock image sites for high-quality images of bread and a few other items on the menu - croissants, cookies, etc. - as a placeholder for the gallery section. My priority was choosing stock photos that looked organic instead of too staged or sterile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staff didn't want to include their Facebook or Twitter pages, so I made sure to include a Yelp button at the very least to reinforce the bakery's reputation - their page had 20 glowing reviews and a nearly 5-star rating. I also included Google Maps to make it much easier for customers to find directions to the bakery.
