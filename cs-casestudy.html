        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Designing a mobile-friendly food truck website. Cheese Sammies is a fictional food truck in Boston started by a man named Bryan who creates gourmet customizable grilled cheese sandwiches in 10 minutes or less.
        </p>
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>
          We were presented with the Restaurant Design challenge at Startup Institute. The challenge prompted each member of the Web Design track to create a website for a fictional restaurant based on a series of pre-written prompts.</p>
          <p>
            In the prompt for Cheese Sammies, Bryan had two specifications:
            <ol>
              <li>He wanted his customers to know the food truck's locations by day, and</li>
              <li>He wanted to share his blog with customers.</li>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="container-fluid process-cont">
            <h1>Audience</h1>
            <p>As laid out in the project brief, target users were working professionals grabbing lunch in the city. Since urban professionals are often under time constraints, Cheese Sammies' unique value proposition of serving gourmet lunch within ten minutes would appeal greatly to them.</p>
            <h1>Team &amp; Role</h1>
            <p>I worked alone on this project during my time at Startup Institute NY. My roles:
              <ul>
                <li>UX/UI design</li>
                <li>Front-end development</li>
                <li>Visual Design: Layout, typography, colors, &amp; images</li>
                <li>Content &amp; copywriting</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h1>Constraints</h1>
            <p>Due to their lack of a social media presence, I wasn't able to add much interactivity to the page aside from the content. For a restaurant with an active social media presence, I would add a Twitter feed as well as an Instagram feed that either captures Cheese Sammies' business account or tracks their preferred hashtag(s) (e.g. &#35;cheesesammies, &#35;sammiesonthego, etc.).<p>
              <h1>Design Process</h1>
              <p>Since the target users were working professionals on-the-go, I decided to highlight the truck's speed in serving food (&lt;10 minutes). In the same vein, I decided on a one-page, mobile-friendly site to make it easier for people to access on their devices. The header of the page also contains a script I wrote that automatically updates the truck's location depending on the current day.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to break the site into 4 sections: Our Story, Menu, and Location Schedule. I also included a link to the blog in the navigation since Bryan wanted to highlight it. Based on the few snippets about him laid out in the brief, I wrote out a short bio for Bryan to put a face to the product. The food menu was broken into responsive columns so that the visitors' eyes can easily scan from section to section, enabling them to mentally "build" their sandwich as they read. I also included the truck's full schedule to allow people to plan their visit, and as a backup in case someone couldn't view the script on top for any reason.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once I decided on the layout and the different sections, I developed the site using Bootstrap.
